CancerDetector Chatbot UI
This project is a responsive, user-friendly chatbot interface that simulates an AI assistant (e.g., for cancer detection) by allowing users to interact via text and file uploads in a single input form. The design closely resembles the UI style of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Features
Single Input Interface: Users can upload medical image files (or other files) and simultaneously send text-based messages via one combined input form.
Dark and Light Mode Toggle: A button to switch between dark and light mode to enhance the user experience.
Sidebar Navigation: A sidebar lists previously accessed tools and applications, providing easy navigation.
Responsive Layout: The layout adapts well to various screen sizes for an optimized user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS3: Styling the web page, including layout, fonts, and colors for both dark and light modes.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity such as theme toggling, handling form submissions, and dynamically updating the chat messages.
Responsive Design: Ensures that the layout adjusts smoothly to different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
